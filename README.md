## üîß Customization

Open **`server.lua`** and edit the **"EASY CUSTOMIZATION"** section:

* **Control Ranks**:

  ```lua
  local CONTROL_WINDOWS = {
      police  = { min = 3, max = 8 },  -- Allowed police ranks
      sheriff = { min = 3, max = 6 },  -- Allowed sheriff ranks
  }
  ```
* **Timer Duration**:

  ```lua
  local DEFAULT_DURATION = 120  -- seconds
  ```
* **Authorized Text Duration**:

  ```lua
  local AUTHORIZED_AUTO_CLEAR = 90  -- seconds after "Authorized" before auto-clear
  ```

Open **`pt_timer.lua`** for HUD tweaks:

* Text position, size, and colors.
* How often the job status is re-checked (`JOB_STATUS_POLL_MS`).

## üìã Notes

* Works with **ESX** and **wasabi\_multijob** for clocked-in detection.
* Very low resource usage (event-driven design.)
* Tested with police grades 3‚Äì8 and sheriff grades 3‚Äì6 by default.
